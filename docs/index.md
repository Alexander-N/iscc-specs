## Better Content Identifiers

Currently, the media industry is mostly relying on identifiers that were designed for physical products such as printed books and magazines. However, traditional content identifiers (like ISBN, ISSN or ISRC) are managed centrally and fall short of the requirements for digital trade.

Freely accessible standard **identifiers**, which are specifically designed for **digital content** and **blockchain** based management, are a fundamental prerequisite for transactions and sales activities in a digital and increasingly heterogeneous media environment.

With better identifiers for digital content, the entire ecosystem becomes more efficient.

## How it works

The major innovation of the **ISCC**: identifiers are generated algorithmically and in a decentralized way from a basic set of metadata and the content itself. This inseparably links any specific content to a specific ID.

The **ISCC** is a unique, hierarchically structured composite identifier. It is built from a generic and balanced mix of content-derived, locality-sensitive and similarity-preserving hashes generated from metadata and content.
