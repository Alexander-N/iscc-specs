# ISCC - Content Identifiers

**The ISCC is a modern, generic, and open content identifier**

## Motivation

With the advent of blockchain technology the Internet is moving towards a network of peer-to-peer transactions. Increasing amounts of dynamic, short-lived and granular contents need to be managed and require new and innovative tools.
 
A crucial prerequisite for content-related transactions to succeed in this new and demanding enviroment is the capability to easily address and identify content. Yet many industries that deal with digital content do not even have strandard identifiers. There is no existing solution for those industries that deal with short-lived or granular content such as journalism. There is also no widely adopted, generic identifier for digital images.

The overhead and costs of manually assigning and tracking identifiers for such contents is prohibitive. But there is a solution to the problem: Auto-generated identifiers created algorithmically from the content itself.

In a multi-sided ecosystem **anybody** may have a legitimate interest to generate or lookup an identifier for some digital content.

Open and accessible **standard identifiers**, that are specifically designed to manage digital content are fundamental for blockchain based transactions and sales activities in our increasingly heterogeneous media environment.

By using standardized, decentralized, algorithmic identifiers for digital content,  all ecosystem participants can engage more efficiently in content-related transactions.

## Key Differentiators

| Existing Media Identifiers           | **ISCC** Content Identifier               |
| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| Centralized issuance                 | Decentralized issuance                    |
| Industry specific overspecialization | Generic content identifier                |
| None or human curated semantics      | Algorithmic similarity & deduplication    |  
| High management costs                | Low management costs                      |
| High barrier of entry                | Low barrier of entry                      |
| Not designed for blockchain storage  | Designed for and registered on blockchain |

## How it works

**ISCC** identifiers are generated algorithmically from a basic set of metadata and the content itself. The ISCC does not have to be manually assigned, neither does it have to be carried around or embedded within the content. The content itself is the source and authority of the **ISCC Code**.

The **ISCC Code** is a unique, hierarchically structured, composite identifier. It is built from a generic and balanced mix of content-derived, locality-sensitive and similarity-preserving hashes generated from metadata and content.
